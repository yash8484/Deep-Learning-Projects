Consider fashion mnist data available on keras datasets.

This is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, along with a test set of 10,000 images.Design a CNN model which can classify the test set with good accuracy.Link for the data is attached
Note:You need to use hyper parameter tuning  for better result.
Evaluate you model on classification report.
